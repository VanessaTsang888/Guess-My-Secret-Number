# Guess My Secret  Number Web App

This project was developed using vanilla [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) .

## Guess My Secret Number

This is a game for one player to guess the secret number that is shown just below the heading with a question mark. Simple type a number between 1 and 20 inside the input box and click the 'Check!' button to submit your guess. When you have guested the Secret Number, the background colour will change to purple and the message 'Correct Number' will logout onto the screen. You may play as many games as you like until your Score is 0. The aim is to get the best Highscore number possible before you run out of Scores. 



## How To Run This App

1. You will need Node to install live server. Do a global install of the live server package. This will allow you to use live server from any command line.

```
npm install -g live-server
```

2. Clone the repro:

```
$ git clone [ past link from repro into here ] 
```

Navigate to the 'start' folder:

```
$ ls [ this will show directory of your folders and files ] 
```

```
$ cd [ type in the name of the folder or file you wish to naviage into i.e. the 'start' folder ]
```

Run live server:

```
$ live-server
```

Once the App has started, you are presented with the game that has a black background colour. To make your guess, simple enter a number between 1 and 20 into the input box and click the 'Check' button.

### Languages, frameworks, tools:

This App uses the vanilla JavaScript as the programming language. The code editor that I recommend is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as this is currently open source and has a number of very useful plugins that are also open source.
